                    <p>
                        As an intern as BNSF Railway, I designed and created the full stack of a Flask web application
                        that showed relationships between projects and events such as maintenance events or outages. All
                        information was pulled from a SharePoint list using SharePoint's rest API and utilized recursive
                        descent parsing along with SQLite databases to power it's rather fast backend. Working with
                        server-less databases was a refreshing experience. The highly dynamic web app utilized
                        Timeline.js to create an incredibly dynamic timeline with one of kind scaling and scrolling
                        capabilities.

                        of Coleman Barkely I Developed computer vision deep learning models using the amazing Cogniac
                        Corporation platform to detect instances of damage on portions of train wheels that existing
                        models were struggling to identify. Being able to combine my passions for machine learning and
                        computer vision was amazing.

                    <p>
                        Like many computer vision applications, my project started with understanding how the images
                        were captured and processed might affect models created from the data. I then created python
                        programs to analyze possible causes of detection imbalances from existing models and presented
                        my findings. My data research lead to real conversation and change.
                        My models continued training with hopes for deployment after the end of my internship.

                        innovative ideas that would contribute to actual issues that the various communities of the UAE
                        were facing under the competition motto: ‘Data for Happiness and Well-being’. I created a

                        and a Self-Adaptive Traffic Signal system based on real-time data. I also created a beta version
                        of a Transit App feature that allowed users to plan routes within and between emirates using all
                        available types of public transportation between destinations.
